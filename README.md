# Simmel Hardware Reference Design

This repository tracks the latest releases of the Simmel hardware reference design.

Currently, the design is at an EVT stage, which means, we're trying to figure out if this thing even works. Furthermore, the mechanical design is more of a concept, there are several key details that still need resolution, including the ultrasound port design and the top battery contact-to-PCB interface. Please be aware!

The repository is broadly structured into electrical and mechanical artifacts. The electrical artifacts include the schematic and PCB design. The mechanical artifacts include the case design and drawings.
