# Simmel EVT1 Mechanical Design

This is a conceptual design for the Simmel device. Many assumptions are baked into
this design, many of which can be easily changed or varied. For example, the number
and type of batteries, as well as the connector type are subject to change. Furthermore,
important details such as the ultrasound acoustic ports and the positive battery contact
assembly are still in the process of research and finalization. 

However, this concept serves a reasonable starting point for discussion and ideation
about the Simmel hardware integration.
