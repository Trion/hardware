# Electrical Reference for Simmel (EVT)

Here are files for a very preliminary version of the Simmel hardware. It probably
won't catch fire, but it also probably doesn't work as advertised. But that's
what prototypes are for!

The Altium files may be importd into KiCAD using [AtoK](https://github.com/stevegrn/AtoK).
